	<h1>Our History</h1>
	<p>
		The Original Grant of lands – Government Order dated 27th April 1882. His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore sanctioned the grant of lands to the Eurasian & Anglo Indian Association (E & AI), Mysore Branch.
		<br/>
		Church Plot: The original grant of land to Memorial Church shown as part of the plan of the Village Site (30 acres divided into 24 plots) and which is itself part of a representation of the E & AI Association to the Government of H.H the Maharaja of Mysore.
		<br/>
		Among the undertakings the Association pledged itself to carry out for the benefit of intending settlers, when the land scheme was projected, was to build a place of public worship. In the meanwhile the late Mr. Gage had donated a sum of Rs. 500/= for the same purpose.
		<br/>
		Subsequently a subscription was raised in Madras to perpetuate the memory of the late Rev. Dr. Henry Bower a prominent member of the Anglo-Indian Community. These sums of money were afterwards lumped together and with further subscriptions and donations raised, independent of any contributions from the Association, the present building, planned by the late Mr. Alex Barren of Madras, was erected, under the local supervision of Mr. A. H. Greenham under the direction of Mr. Barren. It was completed in 1886.
		<br/>
		In August 1894 the E & AI Association of Mysore and Coorg renounced all connection with the control of the building and responsibility for its maintenance and the building consequently came into the possession of the settlers, who since then by mutual arrangement have maintained and used it for the purpose for which it was intended. It was thenceforward, by mutual agreement controlled by a Church Committee consisting of four members – two Church of England and two Non-Conformists, and supported by a common purse.
		<br/>
		The first Committee of 1894 consisted of – Mr. D. M. Paul (Church of England) Mr. G. Crooks (Church of England) Dr. D. Stewart (Wesleyan Church) Capt. H. Foster (Episcopal Methodist Church)
		<br/>
		Alternate Church of England and Non-Conformist services were held by members duly approved of, and visiting clergy held services whenever they came to the Settlement.
		<br/>
		In or about 1898-1899 trouble arose through some subscribers to the Church being refused a vote at the Annual Meeting as a result of which the Church was barred against all denominations on the advice of Advocate Honorable J. Lawrence.
		<br/>
		On a representation made to the Deputy Commissioner, Mr. B. L. Krishna Rao, the then Superintendent of Police was deputed to hold an enquiry and at a meeting of all the Settlers with Mr. Krishna Rao in the Chair an agreement was arrived at with the consent of all parties and subsequently endorsed by the Deputy Commissioner. The terms with which have since and are being carried out by the Board of Trustees.
		<br/>
		The principal terms of the agreement are:
		<br/>
		The formation of a Board of Trustees consisting of two Church of England members elected by the Church of England Congregation and two Non-Conformist members, elected by the Non-Conformist. The Secretary to the Board of Trustees to be elected by the Trustees, to have custody of the Church Building and appurtenances and to collect half the monthly cost of maintenance from each of the congregations.
		<br/>
		The original members of the Board were:
		<br/>
		Mr. W. Green Church of England Mr. D. H. Strang Church of England Mr. D. Stewart Non-Conformist Mr. P. Thorpe Non-Conformist Mr. T. P. L. Joseph Secretary
		<br/>
		Alternate services to be held by duly authorised persons and half the expenditure on all counts to be met by each congregation.
		<br/>
		On the lines laid down above the two congregations, Church of England Section and Non-Conformist (Wesleyan) Section formed their respective Church Committees to regulate the conduct of their worship services, to collect subscriptions in order to defray a moiety of the monthly expenses and other recurring charges incurred by the Secretary Of the Board of Trustees and such expenses as well incurred by each Committee itself in the way of providing for the distinctive requirements of its own congregation such as the purchase of hymn books etc.
		<br/>
		The Secretary of each (congregation) Committee has in all matters been the channel of communication between the Secretary of the Board of Trustees and the Committee of each Congregation.
		<br/>
		In 1977 the surviving congregation of the Church of England offered its space to the Church of South India (C.S.I) and to this day this C.S.I form of worship is followed. Its prayers and supplications as well as the format are akin to the Church of England. However as per the order of the Deputy Commissioner, the edifice and the property continue to be managed by the Board of Trustees and they regulate the special functions from time to time.
